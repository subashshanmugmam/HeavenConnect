Problem Statement
In today’s hyper-connected world, communities often remain disconnected in terms
of sharing resources, services, and support. Individuals possess surplus items, unused space,
or idle skills, while others around them continue to search for these resources. Additionally, in
households and small setups, there is no intelligent system to recognize and manage rentable
items. There exists a lack of unified platform to build trust and transparency especially for the
users to rent items, request help for tasks, rent storage, or even share food with all. Moreover,
managing in-house assets for potential rental remains entirely manual and fragmented. The
absence of such a holistic, AI-integrated system hinders the empowerment of neighborhoods
and efficient resource circulation.Proposed Solution
• A full-stack web application for renting items, requesting
services, and connecting locally
• Integration of a smart IoT camera with an ML model to:
• Identify new persons entering the house
• Notify users dynamically (e.g., need for more chairs)
• Recognize household items and sync with web app
• Users can add recognized items directly to the rentable list
• Features include renting storage space, food sharing, and
neighbor help
• Secure login, geo-location, wallet system, and ratings ensure
trust and safety
• Admin panel to manage users, resources, transactions, and
complaintsNovelty of the Innovation
